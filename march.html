March 27 2019: I changed the navbar today. I previously had it as a list, but there is no way to do that without making it ugly in my opinion. Now, all the contents of the page are at the top of the screen, easy to access. No longer have the need to scroll down to see what I wrote. This will be especially important as I plan on adding new pages to this site as well. I added a page called "march 2019" to the site, so that when I get too many posts on the index page, I can just erase them and put them on the march page. When I get this site looking the way I want it to, I hope to add a "games page" so that I can upload my javascript projects to it, and people can play them. I want to get the CSS right first though. Until then, I will keep practicing my Javascript and put something fun together.

March 26 2019: Just bought the domain, and got the site hosted! My site still looks pretty rough, but I plan on working on that during the next month. A friend of mine told me of a website called bootstrap, and showed me a few interesting things you can do with it, such as making a navigation bar. I will have to give it a try tomorrow, but at the moment I need to study for a test. After the test, I will study for my Computer Architecture test, and then work on stylin' up the site some more.
