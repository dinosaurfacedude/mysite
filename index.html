March 26 2019: Just bought the domain, and got the site hosted! My site still looks pretty rough, but I plan on working on that during the next month. A friend of mine told me of a website called bootstrap, and showed me a few interesting things you can do with it, such as making a navigation bar. I will have to give it a try tomorrow, but at the moment I need to study for a test. After the test, I will study for my Computer Architecture test, and then work on stylin' up the site some more.
