    <p> My name is Daniel R Jones, and I am a computer science student at LeTourneau University. I hope to graduate in May 2020, and my current career goal is to become a system administrator. I hope to one day work in the field of Cybersecurity as a penetration tester, but that is a distant goal. Right now I am focusing on learning the basics at my university, and making side projects to expand my knowledge. As of March 2019, my current side project is creating this website, and learning as much from the experience as possible.
