<p>
My name is Daniel Jones, and I am an aspiring security admin.
For the time being, I am learning as much about computers as humanly possible.
Computers are a broad subject. Servers, webpages, programming, glitch fixing, etc.
It is a little daunting, but I am enjoying my time learning. I am a senior at 
LeTourneau University, and I hope to be graduating in May 2020.

<p>
This website is my portfolio website. I mean to share my side projects, my interests, and what I am up to for people to see.
